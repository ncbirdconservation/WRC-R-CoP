R is a powerful program with many common functions included. However, it also can be extended with the use of libraries. Libraries are components built by others to add functionality.

## Using Libraries

### Installation

In order to use functions from a library, you must install it first. Once installed, you do not have to re-install unless a new version is available.

```r
install.packages("dplyr")
```

### Loading

For each script, you must load the libraries required for the functions to be used in that script. These must be included as lines of code before any functions are invoked, usually at the top of the document.

```r
library("dplyr")
```

## Data Manipulation

### dplyr, tidyverse

## Analysis

## Visualization

### ggplot2

### shiny
