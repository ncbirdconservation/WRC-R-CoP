# NC WRC R Community of Practice
Community of Practice for R users at the NC Wildlife Resources Commission. This repository is a space for collaboration and troubleshooting.

## Purpose

- Promote best practices in data analysis and visualization for research and monitoring projects.
- Build capacity for use of R by practitioners.

## What is R?
R is a programming language and free, open source platform. Originally developed to run statistical analyses, it has evolved to offer robust data visualization tools, including web hosting. Since it is open source, contributors can develop “libraries” to perform specific functions. For example, the “[glm2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glm2/glm2.pdf)” library has functions for fitting generalized linear models.

### Examples
This folder holds some R Script examples.

* [NCSAT_CriterionA.Rmd](examples/NCSAT_CriterionA.Rmd) - An R Markdown script example of analysis for the NC Species Assessment Tool.
* [Example datasets](examples/example_datasets.R) - R includes some sample datasets to test functions and scripts. You will often see examples online using these datasets. The most popular are "mtcars", and "iris".
* [Example basics](examples/example_basics.R) - file with basic R syntax and commonly used functions with comments. Work is progress!

## Resources
* [R Project](https://www.r-project.org/) - open source software required to run R code. Requires IT permission to install.
    * [R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) - platform for running and editing R scripts. These functions can also be done in VS Code. Requires IT permission to install.
    * [R Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/r/) - interactive tutorial for learning the basics of R programming.
* [VS Code](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/XP9KHM4BK9FZ7Q?hl=en-US&gl=US&ocid=pdpshare) - platform for coding and integration of git functionality. Does not require IT permission to install.
* [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) - R package that allows inserting formatted text and graphics within an R Script. This is a great way to share scripts or create reports that can be self-explanatory.
* [GitHub](https://github.com) - Website and platform for controlling versioning of content, used mostly for coding. Can be integrated into VS Code.
