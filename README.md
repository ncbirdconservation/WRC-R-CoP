# NC WRC R Community of Practice
Community of Practice for R users at the NC Wildlife Resources Commission. This repository is a space for collaboration and troubleshooting.

## Purpose

- Promote best practices in data analysis and visualization for research and monitoring projects.
- Build capacity for use of R by practitioners.

## What is R?
R is a programming language and free, open source platform. Originally developed to run statistical analyses, it has evolved to offer robust data visualization tools, including web hosting. Since it is open source, contributors can develop “libraries” to perform specific functions. For example, the “[glm2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glm2/glm2.pdf)” library has functions for fitting generalized linear models.
